# Capstone Snake Game with Landmine, Poison, and Motivation

This Snake Game is a snake game that is more complicate than original. Other than food, we have "landmine" "motivation" and "poison".

Additional rules from the original game is that :
1. You hit landmine, you die immediately
2. Motivation will make you go faster
3. Little poison will just make you drunk (you will go slower), Too much poison will just make you die
